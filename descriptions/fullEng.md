# Task

This is another test task that I did to obtain junior frontend developer vacancy. My purpose was to create an image gallery. Images had to be loaded dynamically from the server.

# Code writing

I decided to use [unsplash](https://unsplash.com) as a server for images loading. I think I didn't use any unusuall thing in this project.

Interesting thing that I had to create page about me as a requirement from the employer and while I was writing this text I decided to create my portfolio page.
